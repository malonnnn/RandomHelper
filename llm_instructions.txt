There is a new companion in the "NewGuy" folder to be added to this project. Here is your todo list, in order

1. Figure out the companion name by reading the files, pretend it's stored in a varable called $character
2. Move all sprites (not copy) from NewGuy/sprites to Sprites/$character then delete the NewGuy/sprites folder
3. Do the same for sounds, both moving and deleting
4. Now check to see if the sprites have extensions, if not, add .png
5. Now check to see if the sounds have extensions, if not, add .ogg
6. Read NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt and add its contents to root SNDINFO.txt then delete NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt
7. If the NewGuy character definition is in DECORATE, convert it to ZScript and name it $character.zsc then delete the source file
8. If the NewGuy character definition is not in DECORATE but already in ZScript, skip to step 10
9. Make sure that classes with defaults extend Actor
10. Make sure lines like RenderStyle Add become RenderStyle "Add"
11. Add parantheses after function names, like A_FaceTarget becomes A_FaceTarget() when in frame states
12. Read the README and apply any necessary changes
