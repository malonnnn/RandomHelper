There is a new companion in the "NewGuy" folder to be added to this project. Here is your todo list, in order

1. Figure out the companion name by reading the files, pretend it's stored in a varable called $character
2. Move all sprites (not copy) from NewGuy/sprites to Sprites/$character then delete the NewGuy/sprites folder
3. Do the same for sounds, both moving and deleting
4. Now check to see if the sprites have extensions, if not, add .png
5. Now check to see if the sounds have extensions, if not, add .ogg
6. Read NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt and add its contents to root SNDINFO.txt then delete NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt
7. If the NewGuy character definition is in DECORATE, convert it to ZScript and name it $character.zsc then delete the source file
8. Give the companion and any of its summoned actors these properties: +FRIENDLY|Species "Companion"|DamageFactor "Companion", 0
9. All of the companion's projectiles must have: Species "Companion", DamageType "Companion".
10. A_CustomMissile references should be replaced with A_SpawnProjectile.
11. A_SpawnItem references should be replaced with A_SpawnItemEx
11. Replace all default bullet puffs with "CompanionBulletPuff". This requires changing simple functions to the full version. Example: Change A_Explode (5); to A_Explode (5, -1, XF_EXPLICITDAMAGETYPE, false, 0, 0, 10, "CompanionBulletPuff", "Companion");
12. Replace all old functions (like A_PlaySound()) with their modern equivalents (like A_StartSound()).
13. Add Alert Function: Insert the following line in all the monster's attack states to make it alert others: TNT1 A 0 A_AlertMonsters(0, AMF_TARGETEMITTER); Caution: Do not disrupt any Goto+<number> offsets. This step might be the most important, so read the attack state logic very carefully, making sure it never fires when the attack isn't going to be successfully fired.
14. Check for Jump() miscalculations. Inserting the TargetEmitter lines and converting to zscript can sometimes throw off jump calculations.
15. Define the new companion in the Globals.zsc file.
16. Add a new Deployer Gun actor in CompanionDeployerGuns.zsc.
17. Add a new Ammo Type actor in CompanionAmmoTypes.zsc.
18. Add an #include statement for the new companion's ZScript file to Zscript.zsc.
19. Make sure that classes with defaults extend Actor if not set
20. Add quotes to string values, like RenderStyle Add becomes RenderStyle "Add"
21. Add parantheses after function names, like A_FaceTarget becomes A_FaceTarget() when in frame states. Goes for all functions in frame states.
