There is a new companion in the "NewGuy" folder to be added to this project. Here is your todo list, in order

1. Figure out the companion name by reading the files. For this example, the companion will be called Superman
2. Move all sprites (not copy) from NewGuy/sprites/ to Sprites/Superman/ then delete the NewGuy/sprites folder
3. Do the same for sounds, both moving and deleting
4. Read NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt and add its contents to root SNDINFO.txt then delete NewGuy/SNDINFO.txt
5. If the NewGuy character definition is in DECORATE, convert it to ZScript and name it Superman.zsc then delete the source file
6. If the NewGuy character definition is not in DECORATE but already in ZScript, skip to step 10
7. Make sure that classes with defaults extend Actor
8. Make sure lines like RenderStyle Add become RenderStyle "Add"
9. Add parantheses after function names, like A_FaceTarget becomes A_FaceTarget() when in frame states
10. Read the README and apply any necessary changes
